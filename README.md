# Vending Machine API:
This example provides an implementation of a
real-life vending machine. The project contains
CRUD operations for the products (add, update,
remove), insert a coin, reset and buy a product.
The operations can be tested with the
documented web service interface "Swagger".

## Requirements:

application on your local machine. One way is to
execute the main method in the “ ” class from your
IDE.
3. After the project is running, you can test the
services here: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/.
